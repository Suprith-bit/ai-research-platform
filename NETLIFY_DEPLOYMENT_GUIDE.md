# 🚀 Complete Netlify Deployment Guide for Beginners
## Deploy Your AI Research Platform to the Web

This guide will help you deploy your AI Research Platform to Netlify so anyone can access it online.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before we start, make sure you have:
- [x] Your AI Research Platform code (research_ai folder)
- [x] API keys (Gemini and Serper)
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] Internet connection

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code for Deployment

### 1.1 Create Netlify Configuration File

First, let's create a configuration file that tells Netlify how to run your app:

```bash
# You can copy-paste this into terminal or I'll create it for you
```

Create a file called `netlify.toml` in your main folder:

```toml
[build]
  command = "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  publish = "."

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = "3.8"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/app"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

### 1.2 Create a Streamlit App Function

Create this folder structure:
```
research_ai/
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── app.py
```

The `app.py` file will contain:
```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def handler(event, context):
    # Set environment variables
    os.environ['STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT'] = '8080'
    os.environ['STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS'] = '0.0.0.0'

    # Run streamlit
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'streamlit', 'run', 'ai_research_workspace.py'])

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Streamlit app started'
    }
```

---

## Step 2: Upload Code to GitHub

### 2.1 Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
   - Sign in to your account
   - Click the "+" icon in top right
   - Select "New repository"

2. **Repository Settings**
   - Repository name: `ai-research-platform`
   - Description: `AI-powered research platform with multi-agent system`
   - Set to **Public** (so Netlify can access it)
   - ✅ Add a README file
   - Click **Create repository**

### 2.2 Upload Your Code

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest for beginners)

1. **In your new repository**, click "uploading an existing file"

2. **Drag and drop** your entire `research_ai` folder contents

3. **Important files to upload**:
   ```
   ✅ ai_research_workspace.py
   ✅ enhanced_display_functions.py
   ✅ requirements.txt
   ✅ research_workspace/ (entire folder)
   ✅ shared/ (entire folder)
   ✅ netlify.toml (the file we created)
   ✅ netlify/ (the folder we created)
   ❌ .env (DO NOT upload this - it contains your API keys!)
   ```

4. **Commit changes**:
   - Scroll down to "Commit changes"
   - Add message: "Initial upload of AI Research Platform"
   - Click **Commit changes**

#### Option B: Using Git Commands (If you prefer terminal)

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /Users/suprithreddy/Desktop/research_ai

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-research-platform.git

# Add all files except .env
git add .
git reset HEAD .env  # Remove .env from staging

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial upload of AI Research Platform"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### 3.1 Create Netlify Account

1. **Go to netlify.com**
2. **Click "Sign up"**
3. **Choose "Sign up with GitHub"** (easiest option)
4. **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub account

### 3.2 Deploy Your Site

1. **From Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Click **"New site from Git"**

2. **Connect to GitHub**:
   - Click **GitHub**
   - Find your repository: `ai-research-platform`
   - Click on it

3. **Site Settings**:
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Publish directory**: `.`
   - Click **Deploy site**

### 3.3 Configure Environment Variables

This is the most important step - adding your API keys securely:

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to your site
   - Click **Site settings**
   - Go to **Environment variables** (in left sidebar)

2. **Add your API keys**:

   **Variable 1:**
   - Key: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `[Your actual Gemini API key from .env file]`
   - Click **Create variable**

   **Variable 2:**
   - Key: `SERPER_API_KEY`
   - Value: `[Your actual Serper API key from .env file]`
   - Click **Create variable**

   **Variable 3 (Optional):**
   - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `[Your OpenAI API key if you have one]`
   - Click **Create variable**

3. **Redeploy your site**:
   - Go to **Deploys** tab
   - Click **Trigger deploy** > **Deploy site**

---

## Step 4: Configure for Streamlit

Since Streamlit needs special configuration for Netlify, let's create the proper setup:

### 4.1 Create Runtime Configuration

Create a file called `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.8
```

### 4.2 Update netlify.toml

Replace the contents with this optimized version:

```toml
[build]
  command = "pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m streamlit run ai_research_workspace.py --server.port 8080 --server.address 0.0.0.0"
  publish = "."

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = "3.8"
  NODE_VERSION = "16"

[context.production.environment]
  STREAMLIT_BROWSER_GATHER_USAGE_STATS = "false"
  STREAMLIT_SERVER_HEADLESS = "true"
  STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT = "8080"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Content-Security-Policy = "frame-ancestors 'self'"
```

---

## Step 5: Alternative - Use Streamlit Cloud (Recommended for Streamlit apps)

Actually, for Streamlit applications, **Streamlit Cloud** is much easier than Netlify:

### 5.1 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to share.streamlit.io**

2. **Sign in with GitHub**

3. **Create new app**:
   - Repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/ai-research-platform`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `ai_research_workspace.py`

4. **Add secrets** (your API keys):
   - Click **Advanced settings**
   - In **Secrets** section, add:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_key_here"
   SERPER_API_KEY = "your_actual_key_here"
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_actual_key_here"
   ```

5. **Click Deploy**

---

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

### 6.1 Access Your App

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
- Netlify: `https://amazing-app-name-123.netlify.app`
- Streamlit Cloud: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

### 6.2 Test Functionality

1. **Open the URL** in your browser
2. **Try a simple research query**: "What is artificial intelligence?"
3. **Check if PDF download works**
4. **Verify the horizontal layout appears correctly**

### 6.3 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| App won't start | Check that environment variables are set correctly |
| "Module not found" | Verify requirements.txt includes all dependencies |
| API errors | Double-check your API keys are valid and have credits |
| Layout issues | Clear browser cache and refresh |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue 1: Build Fails
```bash
# Solution: Check your requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Ensure all dependencies are listed
```

#### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Working
```bash
# Solution: Double-check in Netlify/Streamlit Cloud dashboard
# Environment variables are case-sensitive
# No quotes around values in Streamlit Cloud secrets
```

#### Issue 3: App Crashes on Startup
```bash
# Solution: Check logs in deployment dashboard
# Usually missing dependencies or API key issues
```

#### Issue 4: Streamlit Specific Issues
```bash
# Add this to your ai_research_workspace.py at the top:
import os
if 'STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT'] = '8501'
```
